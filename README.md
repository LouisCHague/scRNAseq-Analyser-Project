# scRNAseq-Analyser-Project
This is the reponsitory for my single cell RNAseq analyser app project. This project is a modified version of a project found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sv8nYeZfP8&t=2527s. 
However, I have included a novel feature, the production of an expression heatmap to help find markers that define clusters. When the heatmap is first produced and when the heatmap is
downloaded it finds markers for every cluster compared to all remaning cells.

The test data for this project was the same provided on the Seurat tutorial (2,700 single peripheral blood mononuclear cells), sequenced on the Illumina Next Seq 500 freely available from 10X Genomics
